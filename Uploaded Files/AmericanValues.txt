1. EXT. DAYTIME SUNNY. ARIZONA BORDER TOWN
US/Mexican border scene. We hear light chatter and
Mexican folk music. From overhead we hover on a sign
“You are leaving Mexico” then on a well groomed Latin
wearing a cap making his way through the line and into
America. He exits the turnstiles to the street and into
the back of a non-descript car. TINO knows the driver
and they exchange pleasantries as they drive away.
2. EXT. EVENING DUSK. ARIZONA HWY 83
Tino and MARTINE are sitting on a truck tailgate in a
desert café parking lot. Tino’s driver is leaning on the
side of the truck smoking. All three are comfortable
with each other but keep a sharp eye out. We notice Tino
and Martine are wearing caps with official logo’s on
them.
MARTINE
One hundred, in two crates, just
like you asked, in the numbers you
asked. AR’s, Glocks, Uzi. The whole
list… Area 7c is clear tomorrow night.
TINO
Sweet as rain brother. If we keep
this up, we’ll be set in no time.
MARTINE
It will be nice Bro. Tell Lucia and
the baby, Maria and I will be down to
visit in two weeks.
Both stand and fist bump lightly. Raising the tailgate,
Tino swings around and gets in the passenger side of the
truck.
Martine turns and with a gang sign, takes a backpack
from Tino’s driver as he heads for the car. Both drive
away in opposite directions
3. EXT. NIGHT. SEEING THRU NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
A small boat with three men landing on a riverbank hand
over two packages to Tino and he puts them in the truck.
The crates are dragged from the truck to the boat.

Exchange finished, the truck drives away.
Pulling back from the goggles, Martine lights a
cigarette then gets into a US Border Patrol vehicle and
Drives away.
4. EXT. MORNING. LOS ANGELES
Tino and his driver drove all night. They round an alley
in a run down neighborhood and stop beside a gate where
PACO, a Mexican with an eye tattoo greets them gang
style. The truck is parked in the yard. Tino and his
driver disappear thru the back door of the house.
Another latin appears and helps Paco remove the trucks
contents to the garage.
CUT TO: INT.
Gang members looking out windows. Gang members are
hovering around a living room table full of contraband.
JUAN is sitting in a tattered overstuffed chair across
from Tino. Guns are visible. With a door slam, Paco
enters the room and motions all is good.
JUAN
(Speaks in Spanish)
Its all there?
PACO
(Speaks in Spanish)
Yes, enough for the whole route to
Chicago.
Juan smiles and nods his head then looks around to the
others in the room. Smiles all around as Juan addresses
Tino. Paco leaves the room again with another door slam.
JUAN
(Speaking in Spanish)
Sit meho. Very good. Tomorrow we go.
Sooner the better, Eh?
TINO
(Speaking in English)
Like a clock Bro. But hey, next time
We gonna need a different cross. My
boy says US side been eye’n our spot.
Its gonna get hot there soon.

PAGE 3
JUAN
(Speaking in English)
Yeah I been hearin’ that. Some are
thinkin’ there’s noise from inside
TINO
Nah. Just how it works bro. You know
the second I see a problem the birds
are gonna eat.
JUAN
That’s right, me too bro. We gotta
keep it clean.
The door slams again with a bang as Paco comes into the
room again nodding at Juan. Juan motions to the same
door.
JUAN
Go ahead, Paco has your cheese in
back. Be careful leaving. Take care.
Tino gives his driver the high sign. The driver stays in
the corner smoking a joint with his gang friends. Tino
leaves the room.
FADE TO BLACK:
We hear two loud bangs. They could be door slams or……
5. INT. DAYTIME. HOSPITAL FACILITY.
A Patient dressed in a jumpsuit is being led down a
clinical hallway by a large intern dressed in scrubs.
CUT TO: OFFICE
A middle aged male doctor in glasses is sitting at his
desk reviewing papers and files. Window shades are three
quarters shut creating bright lines across the murky
room. A knock at the door and the door opens.
The doctor nods at the intern standing in the doorway
and the PATIENT is ushered in.
Glancing up with a practiced smile the doctor motions to
a chair.

PAGE 4
DOCTOR
Please, sit. How are you today?
The door closes and the intern waits outside. Without
answering the patient stares icily at the doctor and
sits while muttering under his breath. Suddenly…
PATIENT
I didn’t do anything! The nurse
wouldn’t..
Crossing his arms and looking down his glasses, the
doctor interrupts.
DOCTOR
No, No. its not that. Do you
remember the talk we all had in
the lunch room last week?
PATIENT
What? Taking spoons. NO. I DIDN’T!
THEY ARE LYI...
DOCTOR
(interrupts)
No, no. When we mentioned that
Funding is being cut back and we may
need to consider transferring a few
tenants to outpatient status.
The patients face changes and he calms
PATIENT
(stuttering)
M-m-me. I’m out?
Pushing paperwork towards the patient and with a smirk
to his grin.
DOCTOR
Yes, you. I just need to read these
to you and have you sign a few places
and we can have you out tomorrow. Ok?
Incredulous, the patient nods with a twitch.

PAGE 5
DOCTOR
Ok then, I need to read this to
you. “You have been diagnosed with
Paranoid Schizophrenia and have been
prescribed…
The doctors voice fades to background and we look at the
patient wearing an obtuse facial expression.
The doctors voice fades back in as he finishes, pointing
and handing the patient a pen.
DOCTOR
..now if you feel that you may be a
harm to yourself or others you need to
call this number here. Do you
understand all of this?
PATIENT
(Nodding shortly)
Yeah sure.
The doctor pulls back the paperwork after the patient
has signed

with a bag over his shoulder and down the walkway. We
see a sign revealing the institution as a Utah Mental

and straight to the room he is in. She is agitated and
nervously confronts her son.
MOTHER
Didn’t I tell you to get out and look

The Patient looks away and mutters under his breath.

Looking around wildly with sun strained eyes he sees an
older neighbor. He half skips over and the neighbor
recoils into his RV with a scared and disgusted look.
PATIENT
Fuck! Don’t freak old man, I just want
a cigarette!
He picks up a piece of wood and smacks the side of the
neighbors RV. Looking away he see’s a younger boy and he
starts over to him dropping the wood.
PATIENT
Hey, you got a cigarette?
The boy answers with only a wave.

The patient is very agitated by now and sees the boy’s
pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket. Reaching out, he
smacks the pack while looking at the boy with disgust.
PATIENT
A cigarette I said. Lemme get one.
What, you stupid? Lemme get a cig,

The Son quickly understands and with a hurried
reluctance gives him one, then fumbling, lights it for
him.

Yeah, you better, why don’t you say
something? You stupid?
Son pulls out his smart phone and starts to write in a
note pad app while showing the patient.

RV park manager CHRISTY is straightening up. The
Patient has been looking for cigarettes again and now
enters the clubhouse. Looking around, he see’s an older
couple talking on a couch and turns away as they both
look up startled. He’s a disheveled mess still in a pair
of old cutoffs and cheap flip-flops, face twitching.
Walking over to the service window from the kitchen he
sees Christy inside and slaps on the counter a bit too
hard. Leaning in.
PATIENT
Hey hey hi hi hey…you smoke? You

need to wait till my dads gets…
He sees her startled look and reads the answer from her
face. She recoils.
CHRISTY
I, I, I don’t smo…
Interrupting, he explodes flailing his arms
PATIENT
OF COURSE fucking not! All you
MOTHERFUCKERS…Lame ASS…Shit…
With one motion he knocks a flower vase off the counter
and shoves the cash register towards her. Christy emits
a low groaning scream as she bolts out the door on her
side of the window.
(CONTINUED)

PAGE 15
CONTINUED:
Across the parking lot and into the office in a flash,
she locks the door and pulls the curtains closed.
Sitting there in the dark Christy keeps her eye out the
crack in the curtains and then to the phone. Never
calling the police, She closes the office early, gets in
her car and leaves.
22. EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. RV PARK
At the picnic table next to his RV, Dad has his laptop
open and notices everyone around as he taps away.
The “Drunk sisters” are sitting not 40 feet away
reminiscing and quarreling. Four twenty-somethings are
stoking a grill to his right and are intent on dinner
and the older gentleman puttering around his rig right
across the lane loves to wave.
Looking up, dad sees the patient at the end of the lane
walking his way. Then, abruptly getting his things
together, Dad goes inside.
CUT TO: INT.
Inside sitting sideways on the couch while using his
laptop. He hears a light commotion going on outside and
strains his ears to hear what’s going on. Then a noise
outside his RV and in a second comes a sharp rap at the
door.
Startled, dad gets up and looks out the opposite window.
Outside is the Patient nervously moving around. Then
quickly he turns and hammers on the door.
PATIENT
HEY! Davin in there? Davin Home?
DAVIN!
Knocking harder.
Dad quickly moves to the door and opens it.
Staring shortly at the Patient.
DAD
Gavin isn’t here, he left this
morning on the bus to Seattle.
He will be back in two weeks.

PAGE 16
The Patient, struggling to listen, suddenly understands
and starts back in on the short rapid addled movements.
PATIENT
Oh..Ok.. Christmas huh? So then…
Hey, you got a cigarette I can get?
Dad has recoiled a bit noticing the Patients drug abused
appearance.
DAD
No, no I don’t smoke. Gavin will
be back then. Bye.
With a short motion, Dad closes the door and thinks for
a second. The Patient is irate. He smacks Dads RV hard
as he leaves and yells. He hears the Patient storm off
and start to harass others nearby.
FUCK!

PATIENT
What are you looking at!!..

Dad picks up his phone and dials 911. The OPERATOR
answers shortly.
OPERATOR
911 Whats your Emergency?
DAD
Hello, yes, hi, Im at….
Dad explains the situation to the Operator and is told
that a Sherrif’s unit is on its way.
Sitting down on the couch Dad strains to hear what is
going on outside.
23. EXT. DAYTIME . OUTSIDE DADS RV
As Dad closes the RV door, the Patient turns and see’s
others nearby watching him and he gets irate. He smacks
Dads RV hard as he leaves and yells
FUCK!

PATIENT
What are you looking at!!..

The patient slowly walks back to his Fathers RV. He is
twitching and talking to himself under his breath. He
gets stares from other tenants. He mutters and yells at
them with violent motions.
(CONTINUED)

PAGE 17
CONTINUED:
He enters his fathers RV and retrieves his Fathers
shotgun. He loads it. He goes outside with the shotgun
retracing his last steps challenging all as they flee.
No-one yells.
CUT TO: INT.
Dad is sitting on the couch pondering the situation. He
hears commotion outside and peeks through the curtain.
DAD
(Thinking to himself
in narrative)
What in the hell is his problem…
30. INTENSE DIRECTIONAL CHANGE
The RV door is thrown open and the patient bounds in
quickly, holding a shotgun. He racks the shotgun.
Noticing it’s a pump action field gun Dad jumps for the
gun.
Dad grabs the barrel as its shoved in his eye and barely
pushes it away as the gun explodes, taking with it a
piece of Dads skull. Dad is thrown backwards and the gun
racks again. Dad yells.
DAD
What are you doing!!
The gun explodes again and Dads right arm is torn apart
at the elbow.
The patient yells
PATIENT
Aaah… Devil!
The gun racks again. Dad rolls to avoid all but the
spray of the next shot then tries to stand. Looking in
the direction of his pistol, he hears the gun rack again
and dives onto the dinette to have the fourth shot tear
pieces of his clothing off his body.
Dad is lying on the dinette, and in the millisecond
before the next shot, thought the next was surely the
kill shot.
Dads mind yells.
(CONTINUED)

PAGE 18
CONTINUED:
DAD
(Narrarating to himself)
JUMP TO YOUR GUN !!!
He rolls and reaches his body over as the click of an
empty chamber lets him know he has a last chance.
Reaching, he realized his right arm was destroyed, then
reaches into the void behind the couch to the pistol
with his left. Secured in its holster, he pulls it free
with his teeth.
Quickly, he swings around for a left handed shot.
DAD
(narrating)
Things seemed clear and concise. I
noticed he was standing in the same
place he started but this time when
our eyes met, mine were failing steel
and his were wide as saucers.
In this time frame, the attacker suddenly realizes He is
now in danger.
Dad
(narrating)
I had such a clean bead on his
head as he leaped and I pulled the
trigger and felt myself falling to
the floor listless.
With a drug induced nimble, the patient leaps back out
the door as 2 shots ring out BANG, BANG! into the face
of a group of neighbors with cocked guns.
The Police arrive on the scene.
Blood everywhere, and with only enough energy for a
faint utterance. Choking and sputtering.
DAD
Why did he do this..
Help Me…..Help
Call 911…….Help…………Why did………………….
FADE TO BLACK THROUGH THE EYES OF THE FALLEN DAD.
